Trikky Wiki
======

Open Source Wiki that uses php/mysql.

Trikky Wiki allows for simple template customization making it very easy to deploy a "unique" collaborative website without much editing.

As to the developement stage; Though Trikky Wiki is still in the beta stage, we are working on the administration interface, hopefully we'll have a complete version soon.
